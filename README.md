# Predicting Prospect with Web-pages
The repository contains an application of the methodology originally proposed by Zheng Tracy Ke, Brian Kelly and Dacheng Xiu in their working paper "Predicting Returns with Text Data"

The step-by-step procedure used by authors was tuned to answer a different question, that is:

**Can we predict conversion probability on prospects using only their webpage text information?**

Common wisdom suggest that may be possible given the _standard_ firm webpage.

## What's inside the repo?
1. The Jupyter notebook, which contains the main analysis;
2. The module `beautifultools.py` containing the _toolbox_ necessary to achieve the final results.

## What's not
The dataset used.
